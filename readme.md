# Teams Former for  The Classroom
This desktop tool utilizes a genetic algorithm (GA) to produce approximately optimal team formations. It iteratively creates new populations (solutions) from the initial population. It starts with a randomly generated chromosome, and in each iteration, it either perform a crossover or mutation to produce a better chromosome, until it reaches the optimal chromosome (fitness function = minimum possible value) or reaches the limit on number of iterations. The chromosome (array) is of the same length as the students in the classroom. The array indices represent the student IDs, and the array cells values indicate the groups numbers assigned to the students, The criteria used to compare students before generating groups assignments is based on three metrics: academic performance (GPA), preferred meetings schedule (Time), and studentsâ€™ aptitudes strengths (Skill). The optimal output chromosome of the algorithm occurs when the average GPA of all groups are equal (inter-teams balance) and there is no conflicts in preferred meetings time and no repetitions of the same skill inside each team (intra-team balance).
